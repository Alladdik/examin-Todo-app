Getting Started with Create React App 🚀
This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

Available Scripts 🛠️
In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

npm start 🌟
Runs the app in development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

npm test 🧪
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

npm run build 📦
Builds the app for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified, and the filenames include hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!
See the section about deployment for more information.

npm run eject ⚠️
Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project and copy all the configuration files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) directly into your project for full control. All commands except eject will still work but will point to the copied scripts.

You don't have to use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and medium deployments, and customization is optional when you're ready for it.
